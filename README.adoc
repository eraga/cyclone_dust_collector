= 3d printed cyclone dust collector
:openscad_lib_name: cyclone_dust_collector

This library contains cyclone filter "with caverns" generator, that effectively collects small particle dust.
Can be used at a shop, as a wooden CNC filter, etc.

Produced 3D models can be then printed. For gaskets a TPU of other flex materials can be used.

Consumer grade vacuum with HEPA filter should be enough. It must be connected to the cyclone outlet hole.

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
git clone submodule https://github.com/eraga/{openscad_lib_name} lib/{openscad_lib_name}
----


== Example usage

[source,openscad,subs=attributes+]
